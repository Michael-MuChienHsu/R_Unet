# R_Unet
This is a on going project applying recurrent method upon U-net to perform video frame prediction </br>

In this project, I proposed a network applying multi layer LSTM on latent feature encoded by U-net </br>
Taking advantage of LSTM and U-net encode-decoder, we wish to be able in predicting next (n) frame(s). </br> 

to train: python train.py config </br>


Overview of network:

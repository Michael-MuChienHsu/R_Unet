# R_Unet
This is a on going project applying recurrent method upon U-net to perform video frame prediction </br>
.._GPU for GPU virsion </br>

In this project, I proposed a network applying multi layer LSTM on latent feature encoded by U-net </br>
Taking advantage of LSTM and U-ent decoder, we wish to be able in predicting next frame. </br> 

to execute: python train.py config </br>
with purposed network:
